FIXING THE REACT ERROR: "Target container is not a DOM element"

The error occurred because React is trying to mount to an element with ID 'root', but that element doesn't exist in your HTML.

Steps taken to fix the issue:

1. Updated public/index.html:
   - Added <div id="root"></div> as the mounting point for React
   - Simplified the HTML structure for a React application
   - Removed direct script references that will be handled by React

2. Updated manifest.json:
   - Fixed JSON format for React compatibility
   - Updated icon paths and sizes

3. Updated service worker registration:
   - Added service worker registration to src/index.js

MISSING ASSETS:
- The icon file 'WF.png' is missing from your public directory
- You'll need to create or find an icon and place it in the public directory

ADDITIONAL STEPS:
1. Make sure your React components properly import any necessary CSS
2. Replace direct DOM manipulations in your components with React state/effects
3. For the Font Awesome icons, you're already using @fortawesome/react-fontawesome

Restart your React development server with:
```
npm start
```
